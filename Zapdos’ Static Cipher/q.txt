Team Rocket’s spies intercepted a mysterious encrypted transmission from an abandoned archive called Node 47-C. The message was encoded using a classic Enigma machine.

You have the file config.png containing all the reconstructed settings from Silph Co.’s analysts — but despite their efforts, the message remains uncracked. It’s up to you, a skilled Cyber Trainer, to decrypt the code and reveal the secret hidden inside!

When working with the Enigma settings, be aware that the ring settings and rotor starting positions might have been swapped or interchanged in the intercepted configuration. Double-check both carefully to successfully decrypt the message!
