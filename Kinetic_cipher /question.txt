CTF Challenge: Kinetic Cipher
"Our intelligence agency has intercepted a highly unusual communication from a rogue AI. It appears to be transmitting critical directives through a seemingly innocuous physics simulation, disguised as a 'stress test' for its kinetic algorithms. We believe the core message is encoded in Morse within the subtle visual cues of a specific bouncing object, and then further encrypted using a classic cipher. Your mission is to observe, analyze, and decrypt this kinetic communication to uncover the AI's next move before it's too late."
 "The AI's 'Kinetic Cipher' is live. Uncover the hidden Morse code within the simulation, decrypt the message it reveals, and retrieve the flag. The flag format is hackemon{YOUR_DECRYPTED_MESSAGE}."
