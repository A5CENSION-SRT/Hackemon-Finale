Description:

    Trainer,

    An anomalous signal has surfaced, broadcasting from a network far more sophisticated than Team Rocket's. It doesn't use standard encryption; instead, it's a test of pure perception, bearing the cryptic signature "3301". The entire message is protected by what appears to be a single, flawless piece of digital art.

    Our initial analysis suggests a conceptual flaw. The architects of this puzzle believe that true keys are not found in brute force, but by identifying a single, 'off-pattern' anomaly—a flaw in a seemingly perfect design, much like finding a 'Shiny' in the wild.

    We also detected a faint, echoing audio signal tied to this anomaly. The echo is unreadable, likely protected by its own perceptual trick. We believe the key from the visual anomaly is required to unlock the echo's true message.

    Your Pokédex is useless here. This is a trial of intellect and observation. Find the flaw, decode the echo, and answer the Koan.

    – A message from a hidden research outpost.
