# üè• Pok√©Guard Neural Network Bypass

## Background
Professor Oak has revolutionized Pok√©Center security by implementing an advanced AI-powered defense system called **Pok√©Guard**. This cutting-edge system uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to analyze trainer login attempts and detect potential Team Rocket infiltration patterns.

The system has been trained on thousands of malicious attack patterns and boasts a 99.7% detection rate against known threats. However, even the most intelligent Alakazam might have some blind spots...

## Challenge Objective
Your mission: Bypass the Pok√©Guard neural network security system and access Professor Oak's trainer database to retrieve the flag.

## Target Information
- **Pok√©Center Login Portal:** http://64.227.170.205:5000
- **Protected by:** Pok√©Guard Neural Network v2.0
- **Security Level:** Maximum

## Intel Report
üîç **Reconnaissance Notes:**
- The Pok√©Guard system analyzes trainer input for suspicious patterns
- It uses state-of-the-art LSTM neural network technology
- The system was specifically trained to detect Team Rocket attack signatures
- Professor Oak's credentials are stored in the trainer database
- The AI system processes login attempts in real-time
