Challenge Description:
Professor Oak once experimented with music and memory. In his archives, seven text files have been foundâ€”each filled with strange logs, web links, and digital debris.

ðŸŽ¯ Your objective:
Hidden somewhere within these files is a musical cipher containing a flag.
The format is: hackemon{flag}

The cipher uses musical notes and is encoded using a specific scheme.
Figure out how to decode it.

ðŸ§  Rules:

- You are given 7 files.
- One of them hides the musical message.
- No brute force is required.
- Think like a musician, decode like a hacker.

ðŸŽ¼ Solve the melody. Gotta hack 'em all!

Solution:

On visiting the GitHub repo, we find seven files named after musical syllables, but one file, slo.txt, is a typo (should have been so.txt).
The other files (do.txt, re.txt, etc.) contain junk data like:
LinkedIn URLs
Lorem ipsum text
Rickrolls or broken HTML
Spam comments

â†’ This suggests slo.txt is the only file containing real musical notes. 2. Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Open slo.txt and Read Notes

The contents are:
['G', 'C', 'D', 'A#', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'C#', 'Start', 'G', 'C', 'D#', 'G', 'B', 'D', 'F#', 'G#', 'D', 'C#', 'End']

This sequence looks like a musical encoding using the 12-tone chromatic scale.
Step 2: Understand the Cipher Mapping

The encoding rule (from the provided decoder or challenge context):

    Aâ€“Z are mapped to notes cyclically using:

chromatic_notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']

so,

    A â†’ C, B â†’ C#, C â†’ D, ..., M â†’ C, ..., Z â†’ B

    Multiple letters map to the same note (e.g., C â†’ [A, M], F â†’ [E, Q]).

    Start and End indicate the flag boundary { ... }

Step 3: Decode Using a Python Script

Using the provided decoder.py, or writing one with itertools.product, we decode all possible combinations between Start and End.

Decoded note segment:

['F', 'A', 'B', 'E', 'D#', 'B', 'G', 'E', 'A']

Each note maps to multiple letters:

    F â†’ [E, Q]

    A â†’ [I, U]

    B â†’ [L, X]

    D# â†’ [D, P]

    G â†’ [F, R]

    etc.

When brute-forced using a script:

from itertools import product

# Reverse map logic...

We get flags like:

hackemon{EIPDLXFEI}
hackemon{TYPHLOSION}
hackemon{QUBDPXREF}
...

Step 4: Identify the Real Flag

    Among all possibilities, hackemon{TYPHLOSION} stands out â€” itâ€™s a valid PokÃ©mon name.

Flag: hackemon{TYPHLOSION}
