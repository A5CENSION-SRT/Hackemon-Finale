ðŸŽµ Hackemon CTF Challenge: The Cipher's Symphony ðŸŽµ

Professor Oak once experimented with music and memory. In his archives, seven text files have been foundâ€”each filled with strange logs, web links, and digital debris.

ðŸŽ¯ Your objective:
Hidden somewhere within these files is a musical cipher containing a flag.
The format is: hackemon{flag}

The cipher uses musical notes and is encoded using a specific scheme.
Figure out how to decode it.

ðŸ§  Rules:
- You are given 7 files.
- One of them hides the musical message.
- No brute force is required.
- Think like a musician, decode like a hacker.
